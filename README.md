# Anoze.co Energy Saas App

# Updates

Authentication using username and pin.
This makes it easier for users to remember their login details.

How did i do this?
I stored the phone no. in the email column in my db field, and stored the 4-digit pin as the password.


# Created a symbolic link using 
php artisan storage:link
The [-/anoze/public/storage] link has been connected to [-/anoze/storage/app/public].
The links have been created.

-> Fixed all buttons, + a ton of other micro-fixes
-> Fuel Levels not fixed yet
